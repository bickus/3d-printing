# Motor Torque Sim with Torque Curves
Eddietheengineer's motor torque spreadsheet with two updates:
- Incorporated torque curves in general, and for some of the motors I'm interested in. Just add a table with RPM and torque, then reference it in the motor database sheet

- Added an AWD multiplier for the available torque. In my case, values around 1.6–1.8 are more realistic than simply doubling the torque
